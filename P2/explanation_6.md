# `get_min_max` Analysis
### Time Complexity
The function iterates once over the entire list `ints`.
So the time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `ints`.
### Space Complexity
The function requires `O(n)` space for the input where `n` is the number of elements in `ints`.
It also requires `O(3)` space for its local variables.
So we have `O(n + 3) = O(n)` space complexity.
